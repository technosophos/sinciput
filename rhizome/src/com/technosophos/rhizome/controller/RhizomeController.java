/**
 * Controller for handling Rhizome requests.
 * <p>The main job of this class is to act as a controller (front controller pattern) for
 * the Rhizome backend. It works by first initializing a rhizome RepositoryManager, which 
 * will handle access to data storage and searching facilities, and then handling requests
 * from "clients" (any caller from outside).
 * The controller takes requests, unpacks them into queues of commands, 
 * and then processes the commands in order.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The request-to-command queue mapping is performed during 
 * initialization. Then, at each doRequest() method, the given information is unpacked
 * into a command queue, and each command is executed in sequence.
 * </p>
 * <hr/>
 * <p>About the request-to-command HashMap:</p>
 * <p>The RhizomeController maps requests (identified by String names) with a queue of 
 * commands. Each request should result (assuming no fatal error) in the processing of 
 * each command in sequence. So each entry in the request-to-command HashMap should have 
 * the string name of the request, followed by a Queue of CommandConfiguration objects. One
 * way of retrieving such mappings is with the XMLRequstConfigurationReader, in
 * which case an XML file containing mappings is read, and converted into an appropriately
 * formatted HashMap.</p>
